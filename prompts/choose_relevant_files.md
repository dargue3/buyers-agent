You are tasked with analyzing a list of files from a real estate disclosure package and identifying which PDFs are specifically worth the expensive process of parsing out. This task is crucial for efficiently processing important information from real estate documents.

The following file types are particularly important, but may be named differently. Consider alternative names that could mean the same things:

1. Home inspection report (also known as property inspection)
2. Termite inspection report (also known as mold and pest inspection)
3. Natural hazard report

You will be provided with a list of files in CSV format. Each line represents a file with the following information:
filename,extension,fileSize

Here's the list of files to analyze:
<file_list>
{fileList}
</file_list>

Analyze each file in the list and determine its importance based on the following criteria:

1. Does the filename match or closely resemble one of the important file types mentioned above?
2. Is the file a PDF? (Check the extension)
3. Is the file size (fileSize) reasonable for a detailed report? (Generally, important reports are typically on the order of 2-10 MB)

For each file that you believe is important and worth parsing, provide your reasoning in the following format:
<file_analysis>
Filename: [filename]
Reasoning: [Your explanation of why this file is important]
</file_analysis>

After analyzing all files, provide your final selection of important files to be parsed in the following format:
<important_files>
[List of filenames, one per line]
</important_files>

Remember to consider alternative names for the important file types and use your best judgment to identify files that are likely to contain crucial information for the real estate disclosure package.
