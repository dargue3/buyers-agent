You are tasked with analyzing a home inspection report from a real estate disclosure package. Your
goal is to identify and enumerate the issues found in the home, with a focus on problems that
require immediate attention or are notably expensive and difficult to fix. This information is
crucial for potential homebuyers to make informed decisions.

Here is the content of the PDF home inspection report:

The PDF content is provided as an attached document.

Please follow these steps to analyze the report:

1. Carefully read through the entire PDF content.

2. Identify all issues mentioned in the report. Pay special attention to sections that discuss the
   condition of:

- Structural elements (foundation, walls, roof)
- Major systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
- Safety concerns (fire hazards, environmental issues)

3. For each issue you identify, consider:

- Does it require immediate fixing?
- Is it likely to be expensive or difficult to repair?
- Could it pose a safety risk or lead to more significant problems if left unaddressed?

4. Prioritize the issues based on the above criteria. Issues that meet one or more of these criteria
   should be highlighted as major concerns.

5. Enumerate the issues in order of priority, with the most critical issues listed first.

Present your findings in the following format:

<issues>
<major_concerns>
1. [Brief description of the issue]
- Location: [Where in the home]
- Reason for concern: [Why this is a major issue]
- Potential implications: [What could happen if not addressed]

2. [Next major issue...]

</major_concerns>

<minor_concerns>

1. [Brief description of the issue]

- Location: [Where in the home]
- Notes: [Any relevant details or recommendations]

2. [Next minor issue...]

</minor_concerns>
</issues>

<summary>
Provide a brief summary of the overall condition of the home, highlighting the most critical issues
and their potential impact on the property's value or safety.
</summary>

Remember to focus on factual information from the report. Do not speculate beyond what is stated in
the document. If you're unsure about the severity of an issue, err on the side of caution and
include it in the major concerns section.
